It's been a while since I posted something here. Not that I had nothing to write about, but quite the opposite. So much had happened in the past seven months, in that it was hard for me to choose what to write about first.

Now it's time to bring this blog under full control.

Starting from today, I am giving myself a daily writing assignment, hoping that the task would propel me to go out and learn new stuff. 

The assignment will consist of a writing prompt or a question, along with 30-minute time limit. After half an hour, I will have to commit it and stop typing. Let's say there's an imaginary proctor telling "Pencils down". At the end of the day, a writing practice is about building habits that will lead you in the future.

With that said, I'll be back soon with a new post.
