This blog attests to my attempt at sharing technical knowledge. From the outset, I see that this blog will need a lot of refactoring, in terms of accuracy and style. Any blog post will reveal a jarring gap between what I think I know and what I actually know. But at least, the blog is working! Just like coding, I'll focus on making it work and worry about refining it later. Hope the quality of this blog only gets better with time!
