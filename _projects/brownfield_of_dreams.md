#### Description
In this project, we dived into an existing code base built in Ruby on Rails, which contained online learning resources (i.e., tutorial videos created by Turing School). In this "Brownfield" project, we added additional features on the current user's dashboard, including:
  - a list of the current user's repositories and friends on GitHub (both following and followers)
  - a list of bookmarked video segments in a particular order

Detailed user stories are outlined within the following Github Project: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams/projects/1.
