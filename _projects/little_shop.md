#### Description
In this project, my partner and I built a fictitious e-commerce platform in Rails. Through the project, we demonstrated our firm grasp of the following concepts:

- HTTP request-response cycle facilitated by RESTful and non-RESTful routes
- Separation of logic via MVC framework
- one-to-many & many-to-many relationships between two tables
- Creation of join tables
- Creation of case-specific flash messages
- Making database queries via ORM (i.e., ActiveRecord) and params
- User sessions holding temporary information of the current user
- Refactoring with partials and filters in views and controllers, respectively
