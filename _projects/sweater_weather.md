#### Description
This project is a JSON API built with Express framework and Node.js. The API exposes four endpoints, including retrieving detailed forecast for a given city, posting a favorite location, listing all favorite locations, and deleting an existing location. The project uses a starter repo from Turing School's Backend Module 4, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/all-your-base).

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Knex.js (a query builder for JavaScript), Promises, async-await functions, as well as many advantages of the modular nature of JavaScript.
