#### Description
In this project, I built an online learning platform for an existing online writing course. Through this app, both instructors and students can better organize their workflow:

#### For students
 - They can submit their weekly writing assignments
 - They have access to an archive of their previous essays
 - They can receive customized feedback from their instructors in real time
 - They can keep track of their individual as well as class progress displayed in charts (from Material Design Bootstrap)

#### For instructors
- They have more flexibility in managing their curriculum
- They can monitor each student's progress
- They have access to all students' data formatted in JSON
- They can perform CRUD functionalities on weekly prompts and feedback for student essays
- They can create highly visual, customized feedback for each student
