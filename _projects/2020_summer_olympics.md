#### Description
In this 48-hour coding challenge, I built a Node API exposing 7 endpoints. They display analytical data from the 2016 Summer Olympics, including a list of all olympians and events, fetching the youngest/oldest olympian, olympian aggregate stats, country-specific stats, etc. These endpoints were tested with Jest and deployed to production, embedded with swagger api documentation.
