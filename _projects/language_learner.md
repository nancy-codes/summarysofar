#### Description
This was a capstone project at Turing School, in which a group of four Mod 4 students had a chance to collaborate across frontend and backend programs. Our team was given two weeks to work on this project. We followed the agile process for project management and decoupled the app such that two people worked on building the frontend in Vue, and the other two worked on building a JSON API backend in Python and Flask.

The main objective of this web app is to help ESL students to learn English better. It does mainly two things: 1) strengthening the user's knowledge of English vocabulary through flashcards, and 2) testing the user's grasp of English grammar by checking the ability to identify errors in grammatically incorrect sentences. For more information about the project, please visit [FE](https://github.com/nancylee713/AILanguageTutor_FE) and [BE](https://github.com/nancylee713/AILanguageTutor_BE) repositories.
