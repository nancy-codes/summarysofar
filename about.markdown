Hi! My name is Nancy Lee. I started my coding journey with Ruby/Ruby on Rails in 2019 from <a href="https://turing.edu/">Turing School of Software and Design</a> (based in Denver, Colorado). Now, working as a fullstack developer, I'm exploring a handful of languages and frameworks, including React/TypeScript, Nest, and Python/Flask. Simple design patterns, test-driven development, and robust documentation are three keywords that guide my development practice and exercise.
