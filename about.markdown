Life is not all about programming, but it can make life a little easier. As a developer, I can turn a string of ideas into a functional app, automate repetitive tasks, and help others solve their problems. A development process, however, is not glamorous at all. It requires rigorous testing, incremental improvements, and continuous debugging to make something work. It will be a challenging journey, but I believe the reward outweighs the efforts. It is rather a privilege to be part of this pipeline from which practical solutions emerge.

As a junior developer, I have just begun to explore the tech community. I am eager to find out what drives the current tech scene, find collaborators to work on future projects, and grow continually as a lifelong learner. To pay it forward in the tech community, I would like to start out by sharing TIL's through this blog as well as helping young students learn to code.
