Hi! My name is Nancy Lee. I am a software developer, mostly working in Ruby, Rails and Python. I care about simple design patterns, test-driven development, and robust documentation. I am also keen on exploring machine learning, neural nets and other cool projects. In a screen-free world, I love to walk, write, and take pictures of rare and exotic plants.
