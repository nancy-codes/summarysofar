Here are some "anti-patterns" beyond the realm of coding that I got into by choice, and I am meaning to get rid of them to ensure a happy, healthy life.

1. ~~Multitask~~ &nbsp; `Think OOD (Object-Oriented Design)`
> Timebox each activity, and give undivided attention to that one thing. This implies that you have a to-do list with a timestamp on each line. Once time's up, drop it and take 5. Move onto the next activity. Some people find context-switching difficult, but it can be practiced. Being persistent and not allowing yourself to take a break are two different stories.

2. ~~Drink Coffee~~ &nbsp; `Drink water`
> Be mindful of how much you consume caffeine. It's perfectly fine to use a cup of coffee to stay awake; but if you're drinking more than three cups a day, that's a little concerning. Find healthy alternatives, like water! <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="potable_water" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f6b0.png">ðŸš°</g-emoji>

3. ~~Work Nonstop~~ &nbsp; `Take 5`
> A pom break is the interval of time off-screen. That includes your phone too. I am acutely aware how hard it is to resist that stimulation. But working with poor ventilation will entail grim health consequences. Please, be gentle with your brain.

4. ~~Stay quiet~~ &nbsp; `Say something`
> You're working with another developer, and he/she would appreciate if your thought process is audible. Get into the habit of thinking out loud.

5. ~~Think about the perfect answer~~ &nbsp; `Ask clarifying questions`
> What do "smart" people do? They ask questions, make requests, and get what they want! If you are smart enough to ask questions up front in your problem-solving process, you are a lot closer to the answer.
